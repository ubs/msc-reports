[How Flex Apps are built]
Learn how Flex applications are architected
When you build an application, you should architect it so that it can be easily maintained,
extended and reused. Instead of having a single monolithic interface, break up the interface 
into separate views (that are typically separate MXML components); build collections of independent, 
loosely coupled components that define and broadcast custom events that the rest of the application can 
then listen for and respond to. You can develop your own methodology for organising your data, logic, views 
and notifications, or you can use one of the many microarchitectures, including Cairngorm, PureMVC, Parsley, Mate or Swiz.
